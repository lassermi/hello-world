# hello-world
My first repository!

Hi Humanoids! I am a postdoc researcher at UCSF studying developmental neurobiology and working with frogs as a model system!

I am learning how to use Git and start my coding adventure! I want to use the skills acquired to create programs for analyzing my data in an automated fashion.
